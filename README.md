# J-Travel

Construction of a 3-layer WEB application deployed in a cloud (PaaS), using an agile approach, the languages
and protocols needed (html, xml, http, CSS, etc.), and a relational database (MySQL). 

The REST API concept was used to decouple the front from the back.

For its operation it is necessary to download the extensions used and run **app.py** in the VisualStudio Code terminal.
